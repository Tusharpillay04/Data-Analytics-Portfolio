# Urban Company Performance Analysis (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive performance and operations analysis based on **hypothetical service booking data inspired by Urban Company’s home services platform**. The analysis focuses on understanding how **service quality, customer retention, and operational utilization** impact overall platform and partner performance.

The dataset simulates approximately **27,000 cleaning service bookings** across multiple partner companies in **Dubai** over a **two-month period**.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Analyze service ratings at cleaner and company levels  
- Understand the relationship between ratings and repeat bookings  
- Evaluate cleaner and company utilization during working hours (10:00–22:00)  
- Identify operational inefficiencies affecting retention and utilization  
- Propose data-driven recommendations to improve performance  

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes:
- Booking ID and booking date  
- Cleaner name  
- Company code  
- Job duration (hours)  
- Job rating (1–5 scale)  
- Booking type (First-time vs Repeat)  

Performance is primarily measured using:
1. **Average daily utilization (hours/day)**
2. **Average rating per cleaner and company**

## 🔍 Key Insights

### Cleaner Rating Performance
- Over **85% of cleaners are rated above 4.3**, indicating strong service quality  
- Around **15% of cleaners fall below a 4.0 rating**, representing improvement opportunities  
- Rating distribution is skewed towards the higher end  

---

### Ratings vs Repeat Bookings
- Cleaners rated **4.8 and above achieve ~62.8% repeat booking rates**  
- Repeat bookings increase consistently with higher rating bands  
- Service quality is a strong driver of customer retention  

---

### Company Rating vs Customer Retention
- Higher-rated companies generally show stronger repeat booking behavior  
- Some companies underperform in retention despite acceptable ratings  
- Operational efficiency plays a key role beyond service quality alone  

---

### Cleaner & Company Utilization
- Overall company utilization is structurally low at **~20%**  
- Equivalent to roughly **2.4 working hours per cleaner per day**  
- Utilization is uneven:
  - ~39% of cleaners work **4.8+ hours/day**
  - ~23% of cleaners are **underutilized (<3.6 hours/day)**

## 🧠 Strategic Recommendations

### Improve Service Quality & Retention
- Target coaching and monitoring for low-rated cleaners (<4.0)  
- Incentivize and promote high-performing professionals (4.8+)  
- Encourage customers to rebook preferred cleaners  

### Increase Utilization Through Smarter Scheduling
- Stack multiple jobs per cleaner within the same day  
- Reduce idle gaps by clustering bookings by time and location  
- Use dynamic pricing to shift demand to off-peak slots  

### Optimize Supply–Demand Balance
- Align active cleaner supply with demand patterns  
- Limit excess availability during low-demand periods  
- Set utilization benchmarks (6–8 hours/day target)
